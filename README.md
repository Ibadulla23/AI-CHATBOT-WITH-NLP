An AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an intelligent system designed to simulate human-like conversations through text or voice by interpreting, processing, and responding to natural language inputs. These chatbots utilize NLP techniques to understand user intent, extract meaningful information, and generate relevant responses.

ðŸ§  Core Functionality
The chatbot architecture typically involves the following components:

Natural Language Understanding (NLU):
This component parses user input, detects intent (e.g., asking a question, making a request), and extracts entities (e.g., names, dates, locations).

Dialogue Management:
This manages the flow of conversation, deciding how to respond based on the context, user history, and detected intent.

Natural Language Generation (NLG):
Converts the chatbotâ€™s internal response into a human-readable message.

Response Delivery:
Sends the generated response back to the user through the chosen interface (web app, messaging platform, etc.).
